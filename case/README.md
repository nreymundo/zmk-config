# 3D Printable case

The files for the case here are just a very sloppy and crappy remix/edit of Knifa's [Sweep 2.x Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5171857) from Thingiverse to add room for the board to still fit with the power switch installed in the underside. 

I've printed it on PLA scaled to 101% to make sure it could actually fit. If you're using flexible materials like TPU you can just leave it at 100% and _make_ it fit.
